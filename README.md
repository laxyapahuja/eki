# æ˜“ eki
MyAnimeList tracker for local anime files

### eki is a MyAnimeList tracker for your downloaded anime TV series and movies. Supports VLC Media Player for Windows only.

# Installation

```
pip install eki
```

To start using it, open command prompt in the folder which has the name of the anime and contains the episodes.

Run it by simply typing ```eki``` in cmd.
And then follow along.

# Features

Automatic Anime Detection based on folder name.

Assigns all the files to their corresponding episodes.

Detects when there's an episode change and prompts the user to update their list which can be done through the console only.

Automatic updation on the basis of time elapsed. (Currently in progress. Have made the duration parser for every anime but haven't gotten close to implement it yet.)

# How to contribute

You can simply help contribute by opening an issue whenever you find a bug. Also let me know if it doesn't work for your folder structure as it's very different for everyone. I've tried my best to implement measures for all the anime I had but I can expect everyone to find a bug or two.

You can also contribute by forking this repository and then opening a pull request.
